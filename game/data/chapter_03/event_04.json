            "Having settled on an elevator pitch, you now just need the confidence to deliver it. You read once that the best way to cultivate this confidence is to go outside, talk to strangers, and see how interested you can make them with your pitch. At the same time, you're not sure doing that won't explode in your face and end up demoralizing you. You've never been good at talking with strangers, and you're not sure why this exercise should be any different."
